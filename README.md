#GA
Repository created just to learn and practice Genetic Algorithms.

The file MLPXORGA.py have a Genetic Algorithm that trains a Multi Layer Perceptron, to map the XOR problem. 

At the end of the execution, this program should to show a graph convertion of the algorithm, just fork and try. If you found something that i can improve, please just send a pull request.
