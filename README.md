#GA
Repository created just to learn and practice Genetic Algorithms.

The file MLPXORGA.py have a Genetic Algorithm that trains a Multi Layer Perceptron, to map the XOR problem. 

At the end of the execution, this program should to show a graph convertion of the algorithm, just fork and try.
If you found something that i can improve, please just send a pull request.


The Algorithm contains reproduction, crossover and mutation, as reproduction operators. 

This Algorithm was inpired in this link:
